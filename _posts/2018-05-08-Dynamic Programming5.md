## Matrix Chain Multiplication이란 - Wikipedia
Matrix chain multiplication (or Matrix Chain Ordering Problem, MCOP) is an optimization problem that can be solved using dynamic programming. Given a sequence of matrices, **the goal is to find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices**. The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide the sequence of the matrix multiplications involved.
